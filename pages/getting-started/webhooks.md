{% if page.overview %}

Branch's webhook system allows you to receive install and down funnel event data from us as it occurs, for install attribution or conversion funnels in your own database. You simply need to specify a URL for us to send all this data to.

The webhook system is very powerful and customizable. You can register to only receive notifications for specific events, or you can register a wildcard and receive all events. You can specify to only receive an event for the first time a user completes it, or every time. You can also specify receive events only in the case of referrals.

{% elsif page.guide %}

## Register webhook on the Branch dashboard

1. Open the [Webhooks](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/webhook) page.
1. Click **Add a new webhook**

{% image src='/img/pages/getting-started/webhooks/add.png' 2-thirds center alt='add a new webhook button' %}

## Configure webhook criteria

{% image src='/img/pages/getting-started/webhooks/edit.png' 2-thirds center alt='add a new webhook' %}

Here are explanations of what each field on this screen controls:

#### Webhook URL

Enter the URL where you would like the events to be sent.

#### Postback method

Events can be sent either via POST or GET

#### Event frequency

You can choose to receive a webhook for every single event occurrence, or only first time that event is triggered for each unique user.

#### Event trigger

You may select between the following default events: 

| **Event** | **Description**
| ---: | ---
| `install` | Triggered the first time a user launches your app
| `open` | Trigged when the user opens the app after the very first launch OR if a user reinstalls the app after uninstalling it
| `referred session` | Triggered *in addition* to install, open or web session start if a user comes from a Branch link
| `web session start` | Triggered when the user views a webpage using the Branch Web SDK.
| `click` | Triggered whenever a Branch link is clicked on any platform
| `-- other --` | Enter an event you [created through the Branch SDK]({{base.url}}/getting-started/tracking-events#custom-events), or a wildcard (`*`) to return every single event tracked through Branch.

{% protip %}
The `referred session` and `web session start` options will only appear after at least one event of that type has been recorded.
{% endprotip %}

#### Filter (Advanced)

See the [Advanced page]({{base.url}}/getting-started/webhooks/advanced#filters) to read about customizing when events are sent.

## Testing

To test whether your webhook is configured correctly, you can use [requestb.in](http://requestb.in/). RequestBin gives you a URL that accepts events and allows you to see exactly what Branch is sending.

1. Go to [requestb.in](http://requestb.in/) and click **+ Create a RequestBin:** {% image src='/img/pages/getting-started/webhooks/requestbin_create.png' 2-thirds center alt='requestbin create' %}
1. Copy the **Bin URL:** {% image src='/img/pages/getting-started/webhooks/requestbin_inspect.png' 2-thirds center alt='requestbin create' %}
1. Paste this into the URL field of your Branch webhook's configuration screen: {% image src='/img/pages/getting-started/webhooks/requestbin_add_webhook.png' 2-thirds center alt='requestbin inspect' %}
1. Now whenever your webhook is triggered, you will see a full report on RequestBin: {% image src='/img/pages/getting-started/webhooks/requestbin_response.png' 2-thirds center alt='requestbin response' %}

{% elsif page.advanced %}

## Postback syntax

All postbacks are formatted the same way, except for those triggered by `click` events.

{% protip %}
To read about the parameters in the link data dictionary, see the [Configuring Links]({{base.url}}/getting-started/configuring-links) page.
{% endprotip %}

    stage: 'stage label'
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Filters

Filters allow you to specify when a webhook gets sent to your URL based off criteria matches. You can configure your filters to use any [webhook keyword value](#webhook-keyword-values) by using liquid tags following this convention: {% raw %}`{{ param.name }}`{% endraw %}. 

{% example title="Filtering signups by location" %}
Let's say you're interested in receiving a webhook every time your `sign_up` event is triggered, but only in a specific market, like Chicago. Your event metadata will look something like the following:

{% highlight js %}
event: {
    name: "sign_up",
    metadata: {
        "city" : "Chicago",
        "username" : "john_smith_1",
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

You would configure a filter to fire a webhook only when `city` is equal to Chicago: `event.metadata.city : Chicago`

The end product would look like this:

{% image src="/img/pages/getting-started/webhooks/filters.png" 2-thirds center alt="webhook filter configuration" %}
{% endexample %}

{% protip title="Wildcard filtering" %}
If you want to filter on just a key being present, you can put a `*` in the value box.
{% endprotip %}

## Integrating with a third-party service

Let's say you want a webhook to fire for all `install` events driven by a single Branch link. This typically occurs if you run a campaign with an ad provider and they need install information posted back to their servers. You can use filters to accomplish this goal.

1. Create a link through the [Marketing page](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/marketing). This is the link you will give to your ad provider.
1. Once you have added necessary data to the link and saved it, you must grab its ID. The simplest way to do this is by taking the full link (**https://bnc.lt/abcd/a1b2c3d4e5**), and appending `?debug=1` to the end (**https://bnc.lt/abcd/a1b2c3d4e5?debug=1**).
1. Enter that URL inside your browser. You will see all of the link's details, including a section that says `Data`. Inside that section, the ID of the link itself is present (~id). Grab the value for that ID. For our example, let's assume the ID is 12345.
1. With this information handy, go to the [Webhooks page](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/webhook) and set one up for `install` events.
1. Go to the filters drop down for that webhook, and add the following key/values pairs:

| Key | Value
| --- | ---
| identity.link_data.~id | 12345
| event.metadata.referred | true

Since these filters are ANDs (not ORs), both filter values must be satisfied at the time of the event for the webhook to fire. In this example, that means **only** someone installing your app after clicking the Branch link with an ID of 12345 will fire this webhook.

The picture below shows a webhook with properly-configured filters.

{% image src="/img/pages/getting-started/webhooks/filters1.png" 3-quarters center alt="webhook filter configuration" %}

{% protip title="Testing Branch Tracking Links" %}

Once filters are correctly set, you will want to test using your device. Since installs are uniquely tracked per device, you must ensure that you are [in debug mode]({{base.url}}/getting-started/integration-testing#use-debug-mode-to-simulate-fresh-installs).

After debug mode is enabled, do the following steps to verify your webhook works as expected:

1. Uninstall your app from your device
1. On your device, open the Branch link you wish to test 
1. Re-install your app
1. Confirm an install event occurs by looking through the SDK's session initialization callbacks and verifying `+clicked_branch_link` and `+is_first_session` both equal `1`.

If all steps are met, your webhook will fire as expected.

{% endprotip %}


## Templating

If your backend relies on a dynamic URL structure to receive events, then we can support you with our webhooks. This is typically used for marketing campaigns, where a unique parameter needs to be appended to each link-click, and consequently posted back to a URL. You can also expose data we collect on the URL itself.
 
To access template values when setting up a webhook, you use liquid tags following this convention: {% raw %}`{{ param.name }}`{% endraw %}. We'll pass through that value we have saved in our database. Here are the two options for templates and webhooks:

### Query parameters on Branch links

Let's say you have created a Branch link in the Marketing tab specifically for SEM campaigns and want to track query parameters. Potentially something like this: **http://bnc.lt/my-sf-campaign?clickId=12345**

You want to return that value **clickId** value (`12345`) back to your backend. Any query parameter you add to Branch Links will be captured in our database and available for you to use in this format: `session.link_click.query.[key]`. So, if you had `?clickId=5&deviceId=7` appended to the link URL, you could retrieve those values as `session.link_click.query.clickId` and `session.link_click.query.deviceId`. In case there isn't anything, it'll simply be empty.

**NOTE:** this works for all types of Branch links, and not just Marketing links.

{% image src="/img/pages/getting-started/webhooks/templates.png" full center alt="webhook template configuration" %}


### General templates without query parameters

If you want to add other parameters, you can configure your templates to use any [webhook keyword value](#webhook-keyword-values). For example, let's say you have an endpoint that accepts a GET with the required parameters `device.id`, and `event.name`. In this case, that would look like the following:

{% image src="/img/pages/getting-started/webhooks/templates2.png" full center alt="webhook template configuration" %}

## Webhook keyword values

Branch has a wide variety of data keys you can access when building your filters and templates. All events offer the same keys, with the exception of `click`.

### Click events

When a Branch link is opened, triggering a `click` event, you may access:

- Properties of the visitor who opened the link.
- Properties of the link that was opened.

| Key | Description
| --- | ---
| click.query.key | Any key that was appended to the link when opened. To retrieve `value1` from **https://bnc.lt/test?param1=value1**, you would use `click.query.param1`.
| click.browser.branch_id | The Branch ID we have for a user's unique browser
| click.browser.metadata.userAgent | The user agent of the browser
| click.device.hardware_id | For iOS, this is the Advertising ID. For Android, this is the Android ID
| click.device.metadata.google_advertising_id | Android only. The Google Advertising ID, if known
| click.device.metadata.os | The OS of the device
| click.device.metadata.os_version | The OS version
| click.date | Time of link click.

| Key | Description
| --- | ---
| click.link_data.~id | ID of the link
| click.link_data.~creation_source | How the link was created, e.g. iOS SDK, API, etc.
| click.link_data.~tags | Tags of the link
| click.link_data.~campaign | Campaign of the link
| click.link_data.~channel | Channel of the link
| click.link_data.~feature | Feature of the link
| click.link_data.~stage | Stage of the link
| click.link_data.$one_time_use | Whether this was a one time use link or not
| click.link_data.$one_time_use_used | Whether this one time use link was used or not
| click.link_data.$identity_id | Branch internal identity of user who generated the link
| click.link_data.$match_duration | Length of time (in milliseconds) that a match could have occurred
| click.link_data.+url | The full URL of the link, e.g. bnc.lt/m/abcde12345
| click.link_data.key | Any key value you specified in the link's data dictionary
| click.referring_identity.id | ID you set for the user who created this link

### All other events

When a user triggers an event inside your app, either one [created by you]({{base.url}}/getting-started/tracking-events) or one tracked by Branch automatically (`install`, `open`, `referred session`, and `web session start`), you may access:

- Properties of the event.
- Session properties of the user who triggered the event.
- Identity properties of the user who triggered the event.

{% protip title="Identity vs. Session" %}
**Identity properties** are set *once*, the very first time Branch sees a user. Once set for each user, these are never changed. **Session properties** are the data of the *most recent* record Branch has for a user.

For an initial `install` event, identity and session properties will be the same. For `open` events, session properties will be different if the user has subsequently opened another Branch link.
{% endprotip %}

#### Event data

| Key | Description

| event.metadata.ip | The IP address of the user
| event.metadata.key | Data defined as `key` when creating a custom event 
| event.date | Timestamp of when the event occurred

#### Identity data

Identity data is unique for each user Branch tracks. These values are permanently tied to that user, meaning if a link with a campaign of 'google' drives an install, then that user will have a permanent `identity.link_data.~campaign` value equal to 'google'.

{% protip %}
Except for `identity.id`, these will not be populated if the user installed your app without opening a Branch link first.

## FAQs

##### Why is my app not sending a device ID?

Check to see if you are in [Test Mode]({{base.url}}/getting-started/integration-testing) with your SDK. If we are sending a fake ID to simulate installs, we will not send it inside a webhook.

##### How can I ensure a webhook is from Branch?

Right now, we do not support a encryption method to verify requests come from Branch. As a workaround, if you [create events through the Branch SDK]({{base.url}}/getting-started/tracking-events#custom-events), you can specify a secret key inside the event metadata to pass through inside the URL of the webhook itself. 

##### What's the difference between first referring data and session referring data?

Because webhooks are event based, and tie back to a unique user, we send you data from the link that first drove this unique user into your app. Then, if they click another Branch link later, we also send you session referring data from this second link. For an initial install event, these should be the same. For any subsequent events, session referring data may be different.

{% protip title='Referral attribution after install'  %}
By default, users only get attribution for installs if the users they refer download the app for the first time. If a user sends a link to a second user who already has the app, it doesn't "count" as a referral. To override this behavior, check out the setting `isReferrable` [here](/recipes/advanced_referral_incentives/{{page.platform}}/#isreferrable).

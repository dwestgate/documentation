Setting the URI scheme is not strictly required if you are only going to use Branch to measure the number of clicks for a given link. To obtain the number of installs, to deeplink to your app, or to do [anything else that Branch enables you to do](https://branch.io/features/), you need to choose a URI scheme and make sure it is consistent between the Dashboard.

URI schemes are particular to the platform. {% if page.ios %}For iOS apps, the URI scheme can be specified in the .plist file under URL Types.{% endif %}{% if page.android %}For Android apps, the URI scheme can be specified in your project's manifest file.{% endif %} If you haven't added one to your {{page.platform_formatted}} app yet, you should choose a unique identifier for your app that no one else will use (e.g. `com.yourapp://`).

{% section client_uri %}For more details on finding/setting your URI scheme in the client, check out [Configuring the Client](/recipes/configuring_client_apps/{{page.platform}}/)'s section on [URI scheme](/recipes/configuring_client_apps/{{page.platform}}/#uri-scheme).{% endsection %}

When you know or have decided on which URI scheme your app is going to use, add the base URL to the Branch Dashboard under Settings > [Link Settings](http://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings/link).

Google AdWords can be a powerful platform for reaching users through Google's search network ads and services. 

To get started with creating deep linked AdWords ads, first create a campaign and ad group.  
{% image src="/img/ingredients/adwords/campaign_creation.png" 3-quarters center alt="Campaign Creation" %}
Set keywords that will trigger your ad to show when people are searching using Google. When setting display URLs and final URLs for ads, makes sure to link to either your {% if page.android %}Google Play Store{% endif %}{if page.ios}App Store page. The rest of the settings are up to you! 

After your campaign and ad group are created, proceed to the 'Ads' tab to create your first ad. Again, make sure to make your display URL and Final URL link to your download page. Check off the box for 'mobile' next to 'Device preference'.

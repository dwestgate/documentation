## Funnels

You can construct conversion funnels of both Branch-defined events and [custom events](/recipes/advanced_referral_incentives/{{page.platform}}/#custom-events). At the bottom of the Dashboard's [Summary](https://dashboard.branch.io/#) page you can see Conversions.

Simply select two or more events to see a conversion funnel. For example, if you track a custom event called purchase, you can track how many referred sessions led to purchases.

This is how the funnel looks:

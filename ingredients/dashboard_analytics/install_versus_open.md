## Install versus Open

We measure installs and opens separately: 

* An `install` is the very first time a user launches the app. 
* An `open` is trigged any other time the user opens the app after the very first launch OR if a user reinstalls the app after uninstalling it.
* A `web session start` is triggered when the user views a page that is utilizing the Branch web SDK.
* A `referred session` is triggered _in addition_ to install and open when a user comes from a Branch link.

## Influencers: Your Best Users

Branch allows you to easily see which users are driving the most actual installs -- not just pressing the share button the most.

To see this info, follow the required steps for configuring your {{page.platform_formatted}} app, which can be found in our quick-start guide [Integrating the SDK](/recipes/quickstart_guide/{{page.platform}}/). After you have done this and users start to invite other users, you will see the [Influencers](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/referrals/influencers) page, which is part of the Referrals section.

Here's what your results should look like:

![influencers](/img/ingredients/analytics_and_custom_events/influencers.png)
{% image src='/img/ingredients/analytics_and_custom_events/influencers.png' 3-quarters center alt='influencers' %}

{% protip title='Identify your users!' %}
You must [identify your users](/recipes/quickstart_guide/{{page.platform}}/#identifying-your-users) in order for the `User ID` column to be populated.
{% endprotip %}


The `Branch ID` refers to the internal Branch ID associated with that user. It is set automatically in the SDK.

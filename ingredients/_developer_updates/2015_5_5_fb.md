## 2015-5-5 Facebook Updates

Facebook has made a couple of changes in the past two weeks that may impact you. 

**First**, Facebook is starting to reject links to pages whose og:image tag points to an image hosted on _some_ S3 buckets.

It sounds odd, but it resulted in these posts being marked as spam or missing the preview image. We have already pushed a change to our backend and moved all images to a new location, so any links you generate with us going forward should be good to go. *Any links previously shared to Facebook may need to be scraped again via the Facebook Object Debugger--if you plan to reuse those links.* Past shares are not impacted, and non-cached links are not impacted.

This issue manifests itself two different ways, depending on where the page was shared. If shared on **desktop**, the user has to verify that they are human before posting (done by selecting certain images). If shared on **mobile**, no verfication is done but then the link is marked as spam and anyone clicking on the link will be warned about "Leaving Facebook".

**_Action:_** if you have images hosted on S3 that are referenced by an og:image tag, go to the Facebook Object Debugger, check the scraped information for those pages with the og:image tags, and re-scrape if necessary. If you are able to share links via desktop web without having to verify that you are a human (you'll know), you're not impacted. Also, consider trying to share your links then filing a bug report via the link in the screenshot below:

**Second**, Facebook's latest app update on iOS pushed some sort of change that impacts the UIActivityViewController. Facebook no longer allows NSStrings to be shared. Our Branch-provided subclass of UIActivityItemProvider returned an NSString as a placeholder, so the Facebook option stopped showing up at all in the UIActivityViewController. We just pushed a fix to the SDK so that the placeholder item is an NSURL.

Related, even with an NSURL, you can no longer pre-populate text when sharing to Facebook via the UIActivityViewController. Any strings passed in will be ignored. This has apparently been a violation of Facebook's Terms of Service but they weren't enforcing it on iOS up until now.

**_Action:_** if you use the Branch UIActivityItemProvider, *update your iOS SDK to the latest version*. If you use normal UIActivityItemProviders, make sure at least one of them returns an NSURL as *both the placeholder and the item*, otherwise your users will not be able to share to Facebook.

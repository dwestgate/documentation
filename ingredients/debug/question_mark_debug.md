## Debugging an individual link

At any time after link creation, you can see all the information about the link with a simple trick. Make sure you are logged into the dashboard and are on the app associated with that link (be sure you choose Live or Test as appropriate). Then enter the link into your browser and append ?debug=1.

You'll see the following screen as a result. It's quite helpful for double-checking your links!

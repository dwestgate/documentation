## Debugging with the Dashboard

For debugging while still in a test environment, the Dashboard's [Debug](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/debug) page offers a transparent look at what is happening behind the scenes. It includes data about:

* the user's identity
* the current session
* the device's digital fingerprint
* the user's credits

To make use of this feature, make sure you include the `setDebug` call. Then open the [Debug](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/debug) page and follow the directions to connect your phone.

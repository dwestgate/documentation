## Promo Codes

At Branch, we are quite opinionated about promo codes: they are an *unnecessary hack*. Promo codes are never the end goal--rewarding users for sharing and giving proper attribution for installs and signups is the end goal. Our links achieve these goals without requiring users to manually copy, paste and validate promo codes.

That said, there are certain situations in which promo codes may be preferable to links, such as printed marketing collateral. (Even then we'd argue for short links--save users from searching through a long list of apps on the App Store / Play Store!) For this case, we provide promo codes. **They are used solely to give users credits.** They are *not* a substitute for install attribution, nor do they create the referring-referred relationship needed to trigger reward rules.

If you want to share promo codes on printed marketing collateral, you can set them up on the Dashboard under Referrals > [Reward Rules](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/referrals/rules) > "+ Add new rule" and choose "Promo Code". Again, these can only be used to give credits to users--they do not 

You can also find methods to create promo codes programmatically, but they are limited to one per user (i.e. one per identity). A simple search for the word "code" will locate the appropriate methods.

Again, we don't recommend using promo codes, but they can be useful in certain cases.

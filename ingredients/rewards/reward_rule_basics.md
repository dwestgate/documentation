To award users for credits, you must set up a reward rule tied to a specific events.

Reward rules can be based on [standard Branch-defined events](/recipes/advanced_referral_incentives/{{page.platform}}/#custom-events) like _install_, _open_ and _referred session_. They can also be based on [custom events](/recipes/advanced_referral_incentives/{{page.platform}}/#custom-events).

To add a rule, go to the Dashboard Referrals page and click the [Rules tab](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/referrals/rules). Click the green "+ Add a new rule" button.

1. Whether the reward occurs the first time or every time
1. Which event triggers the reward

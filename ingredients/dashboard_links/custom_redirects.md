{% section title %}### Custom Redirects{% endsection %}

{% section description %}
**optional**

For any individual link, you can control the _fallback url_ to redirect to when the app is not installed. In the case of the desktop, you can customize the individual redirect endpoint.
{% endsection %}

Note that these redirects only come into play if the user does *not* have the app installed.

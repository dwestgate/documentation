## Example: Using RequestBin to test

{% image src='/img/ingredients/webhooks/requestbin_create.png' half right alt='requestbin create' %}

If you're not sure whether one of our webhooks is configured correctly, take a look at [requestb.in](http://requestb.in/). RequestBin gives you a URL that collects requests, such as our webhook's requests, to see what the client (aka Branch) is sending.

To get started, navigate to their website and click "+ Create a RequestBin".


<div class="full-width">Now you should have a dedicated URL that you can use to simulate your own servers. For example:</div>

{% image src='/img/ingredients/webhooks/requestbin_inspect.png' half center alt='requestbin create' %}

You can test it out using cURL, which is pretty sweet. Give it a shot if you want.

{% image src='/img/ingredients/webhooks/requestbin_add_webhook.png' half right alt='requestbin inspect' %}

The next step is to setup your postback with Branch. Navigate to the Dashboard's Webhooks page and click "+ Add a new webhook".

Now you should copy your URL from RequestBin into the textfield following the label "Send a webhook to".

Choose `Install` for the event.

Now every time someone opens the app, the webhook you've configured on Branch will send a request to your RequestBin. Give it a shot!

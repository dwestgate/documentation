{% ingredient quickstart_preview/quickstart_preview %}{% endingredient %}

Right now, when users open your app for the first time, chances are you have no idea where they came from or who they are. You have no idea if they were invited by a friend on Facebook, found your app randomly browsing through the App Store, saw an ad, or simply discovered it through word of mouth and decided to give it a shot.

**With Branch you can finally tailor the onboarding flow for new users.** Let's get started!


## Generating Links

{% ingredient sdk_links/creating_links %}
  {% override explanation %}
  In the case of a personalized referral system, you can attach information about the user who is sharing the link. Then this information about this user--here "John" with id "1234"--is present anytime John's friends install the app after clicking his link.
  {% endoverride %}

  {% override params %}@{@"referringUsername":@"John", @"referringUserId":@"1234"}{% endoverride %}{% endingredient %}
{% ingredient sdk_links/sharing_teaser %}{% endingredient %}

## The Personal Touch: A Welcome Screen
{% ingredient sdk_routing/routing %}
  {% override ios_key %}userId{% endoverride %}
  {% override ios_key_U %}UserId{% endoverride %}
  {% override vc_name %}userId{% endoverride %}
{% endingredient %}

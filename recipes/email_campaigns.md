This guide will get you started so that you can create links for emails that will properly redirect into the app or fallback to the appstore.

## One time redirection setup

First, please visit the [Branch link configuration tool](https://start.branch.io/) to setup all the link redirection logic.

## Creating a single link

{% ingredient dashboard_links/creating_links %}
	{% override screenshot_description %}One example description if you want to treat this guide is: "Launch Email".{% endoverride %}
	{% override screenshot %}{% image src='/img/ingredients/dashboard_links/add_email.png' half right alt='Description' %}
	{% endoverride %}

{% endingredient %}

{% ingredient dashboard_links/tags %}
	{% override deep_link_data_url %}For information of the form *[key]*: *[value]* such as "product": "shoes", we recommend adding them below--see [Deep Link Data (Optional)](/recipes/your_first_marketing_link/#deep-link-data).
    {% endoverride %}
    {% override screenshot %}{% image src="/img/ingredients/dashboard_links/tags_email.png" half right alt="Link Tags" %}
	{% endoverride %}

{% endingredient %}

{% ingredient dashboard_links/custom_data %}
	{% override advanced %}(Optional){% endoverride %}
	{% override description %}This custom data can be anything you want and is part of Branch's secret sauce. For now you don't need to put anything here. In case you're interested, you add data at the bottom of the link creation process.{% endoverride %}
{% override picture %}{% image src="/img/ingredients/dashboard_links/custom_data_email.png" half right alt="Custom Data" %}{% endoverride %}
{% endingredient %}

This powerful link will now track clicks across platforms. Users who have the app (perhaps you beta testers if you're just launching!) will be linked straight to the app. Users who don't have the app will be taken to the App/Play Store to download your app. And any users who click this link on Desktop will be given the option to text themselves the app!

## Routing

Your app can deliver users a custom experience based on the Branch link they clicked on that directed them to the app.

This means that you can:

* customize the signup/login flow
* take the user straight to a specific screen in your app
* congratulate the user on getting credits for signing up via a friend's link
* ... and so on.

Branch is able to pass data through install. When the user first opens the app, Branch makes a fast asynchronous call to the server to see whether the user has clicked on a link, and if so, what data is associated with it. This means that you should design routing accordingly.

### Example Code
